"Hi,\n\nI'm glad to hear of your interest in the copy of ""A Christmas Carol"" that I have for sale today.  I have to say that the copy I have here is in great condition, and is a real find.  Originally published in 1846 with the original engravings by John Leech.  Everything is pristeen except for a small mark on the binding of the book.  I actually have had sever people interested in the book.  However, the offer of $250 is a little low for what I'm looking to sell for.  On the market ""A Christmas Carol"" goes for anywhere between $400-$800.  Considering the condition of this book and the fact that the only blemish is on the binding, I'd be looking for a sale around $450.",99,"4TXUW ","0","TQGG7 ",2,1,"two","two_99",10,0.0232558139534884
"Thanks so much for getting back to me - I'd love to find a price for your copy of ""A Christmas Carol"" that would work for both of us! I would be able to pay $380 for the book, but I'm not sure that I could pay $450 - particularly since I'm concerned about the blemish on the binding ",99,"TQGG7 "," 6:53:00 PM ","4TXUW ",3,0,"two","two_99",20,0.0465116279069767
"I actually had another bidder on the line earlier today who was prepared to pay $650 for this particular copy, before he saw the binding.  He was an antique collector, and wanted to settle for nothing less than mint condition, so obviously the blemish on the binding was a deal breaker for him.  However, I think that the price cut of $200 that I offered you is very fair considering the condition of the book.  I'd be prepared to drop the price and additional $25 to $450, but considering the market price starts at $400, this is about as low as I can go.

"Hey - what are your parameters for making extra money? I receive an extra 10 cents for every $10 the purchase price is above $300. So if it sells for $400 I get a real world $1 bonus.

If it's somewhere in the middle that works too. Let me know what your parameters are and we can figure it out! ||Hey - what are your parameters for making extra money?
